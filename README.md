üìà Dashboard Overview
1Ô∏è‚É£ Filter Panel

Contains a Year dropdown filter (e.g., 2024) that allows users to view sales data for a specific year.

Makes the dashboard interactive, so users can easily switch between different years to see trends over time.




2Ô∏è‚É£ Sales by Category (Donut Chart)

Shows the proportion of total sales contributed by each product category.

Categories in this example: Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture.

The chart visually highlights which categories generate the most revenue.

Uses conditional formatting:

Darker shades represent categories with higher sales.

Lighter shades represent categories with lower sales.

Total sales are displayed in the center for quick reference.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Sales by Region (Bar Chart)

Horizontal bar chart showing sales distribution across regions (e.g., West, East, Central, South).

Bars are visually shaded to reflect sales performance, making it easy to spot high-performing and low-performing regions at a glance.


4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Metrics (Top Cards)

Total Sales: Shows the revenue generated in the selected year.

Total Profit: Highlights net profit.

Total Orders: Displays total sales transactions.

Year-over-Year Comparison: Shows the change compared to the previous year (absolute numbers and percentage) with a line chart under each card representing the trend.



5Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Trend by Subcategory (Column Chart)

Displays sales for each product subcategory, allowing analysis by year, region, and category to see how each subcategory performs across different segments.

An average sales line helps identify which subcategories are performing above or below average.

Conditional formatting is applied:

Darker shades indicate subcategories performing above average.

Lighter shades indicate subcategories performing below average.

Subcategory names are abbreviated (e.g., Appl, Bind, Chai); you can use full names in documentation for clarity.


6Ô∏è‚É£ Top 15 Performing States (Tree Map)

Displays sales distribution across states, highlighting the top 15 performing states for the selected year.

Largest blocks (e.g., California, New York) represent states with the highest sales contribution, while smaller blocks (e.g., Delaware, Kentucky) indicate lower contributions.

Tooltips provide detailed insights for each state.
